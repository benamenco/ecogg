Microbial ecology scripts by Giorgio Gonnella

This collection of scripts complements existing software,
such as Qiime, Mothur or iNEXT.

Usage:
- add the lib directory to your RUBYLIB
- add the scripts directory to your PATH
- source lib/bash_lib.sh in your .bashrc

The directory project/ contains project-specific scripts.
These scripts often contain specific filenames, paths etc and thus may require
manual changes before being employed by the user.
